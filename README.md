# Finance For Engineers (Module 5)
In this module of the Business IT programm, we learn about the main principles of financial valuation of bonds, shares, firms as well as simple financial options. Further subjects are financial and management accounting. Throughout the project we will build tools to calculate and assess certain financial instruments.

## Project
These stock and portfolio value simulation tools are based on the Monte Carlo Simulation and are part of the research project of the Finance for Engineers module of the Business IT Bachelor programm. Additionally to the tools developed, my teammates discussed our research question of *“To what extent does a Monte Carlo Simulation help financial analysts assess possible portfolio and stock returns?”* in further detail. For more information about the report or the tools, please have a look into the report or source code of the tools.

Monte Carlo Simulation is a technique to estimate the possible outcomes of an uncertain event. Based on the distribution of historical data, multiple simulations are run, which provide different outcomes of a future event. The probability of different outcomes is simulated, that can not be predicted due to the randomness of variables. In practice, the simulation assigns a random value to the variable that has uncertainty. Lastly, simulations can be run repeatedly to make up a representative sample of the infinite number of possible combinations.

## Other Tools
These other tools were developed throughout the module.
### CAPM Beta Calculation
- Measurement of stock's volatility in relation to its benchmark
- Calculation of monthly returns of the stock and index
- OLS regression analysis of both numeric variables

### Option Pricing by Binomial Trees:
- Compute the price for European put & call and American put options
- Calculating the implied volatility with Newton-Raphson method and Black-Scholes formula

### Correlation Analysis of Successive Returns
- Visualization of the 'random walk' theory
- Theory of Efficient Markets
